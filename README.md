# tuxedo

A fast, keyboard-driven terminal UI for [todo.txt](http://todotxt.org/).
Vim-style bindings, atomic writes, instant external-edit detection, and five
hand-tuned themes — all in a single static binary.

```sh
brew install tuxedo
```

## Highlights

- **Pure todo.txt.** Reads and writes the [standard format](https://github.com/todotxt/todo.txt) — every line is plain text you can edit with anything else.
- **TUI and CLI in one binary.** Run `tuxedo` for the interactive UI, or `tuxedo <command>` for a [todo.txt-cli](https://github.com/todotxt/todo.txt-cli)-compatible command line (`add`, `ls`, `do`, `pri`, `archive`, …) — scriptable, with `--json` output and `$TODO_DIR` / `$TODO_FILE` / `$DONE_FILE` support.
- **Natural-language add.** Type prose into the add prompt — `Pay rent monthly on the first, show 3 days before due, project home` — and tuxedo rewrites it to canonical todo.txt for you to review and save. Local, offline, no AI service.
- **Phone capture.** Press `s` for a QR pointing at a tiny PWA on your machine's LAN — type tasks from your phone and they appear in the list. Captures land in a sibling `inbox.txt` first, so any tool that can append a line (shell, iOS Shortcuts, cron) is also a capture source.
- **Vim keys, no surprises.** `j` / `k` to move, `dd` to delete, `gg` / `G` to jump, `u` to undo (50 levels), chord prompts (`gg`, `dd`, `fp`, `fc`) with a 600 ms window.
- **Command palette.** `:` or `Ctrl-P` opens a fuzzy palette over every action — type a few letters, hit Enter. Same matcher as `/` search, ranked so start-of-label hits beat word-boundary hits beat mid-word hits.
- **Atomic, sync-friendly writes.** Every change goes through write-temp-then-rename. If another process — Dropbox, an editor, a script — modifies the file, tuxedo reloads on the next keypress (or within ~250 ms while idle) and flashes a notice.
- **Sibling-file archive.** `A` moves completed tasks to `done.txt` next to your file, atomically.
- **Filter, sort, multi-select.** Cycle by `+project` or `@context`, sort by priority / due / file order, and bulk-complete or bulk-delete in visual mode.
- **Saved searches.** Name the active `/`-search with `fs`, then recall it any time by cycling saved filters with `ff`. Stored as plain `filter.<name>` lines in the config — hand-editable like everything else.
- **Five themes, three densities.** Cycle with `T` and `D`. Choices persist across runs.
- **No daemon, no database, no cloud.** One file in, one file out.

## Themes

`T` opens a picker over five built-in themes, including Terminal, which respects your terminal palette.

| Muted Slate (default) | Dawn |
| --- | --- |
| ![muted slate](docs/screenshots/theme-muted-slate.svg) | ![dawn](docs/screenshots/theme-dawn.svg) |
| **Nord** | **Matrix** |
| ![nord](docs/screenshots/theme-nord.svg) | ![matrix](docs/screenshots/theme-matrix.svg) |

### Custom themes

Beyond the built-ins, tuxedo loads any `*.toml` file you drop in
`${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-$HOME/.config}/tuxedo/themes/`. Each one joins the `T`
picker in sorted filename order. Ready-made themes live in
[`docs/themes/`](docs/themes) — copy one in and press `T`:

```sh
mkdir -p ~/.config/tuxedo/themes
curl -o ~/.config/tuxedo/themes/gruvbox-dark-soft.toml \
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/webstonehq/tuxedo/main/docs/themes/gruvbox-dark-soft.toml
```

<details>
<summary>Theme file format and field reference</summary>

A theme file is one `key = value` per line. `name` is the label shown in the
picker; every other field is a color value. All fields are required: a file
missing one, carrying an unparseable color, or whose `name` collides with
another theme is skipped with a warning at startup.

**Color values** accept two forms:

- `#rrggbb` — a solid hex color (case-insensitive).
- `reset` or `transparent` — inherits the terminal emulator's own background
  color. Useful for `bg`, `panel`, and `statusbar` when you want your
  terminal's opacity, blur, or wallpaper to show through while keeping a
  custom text palette. Both keywords are case-insensitive and behave
  identically (same effect as the built-in **Terminal** theme).

| Field | Colors |
| --- | --- |
| `name` | label shown in the `T` picker (the only non-color field) |
| `bg` | window background |
| `panel` | filter and detail panel background |
| `border` | panel and modal borders |
| `fg` | primary text |
| `dim` | secondary / muted text |
| `accent` | logo, headings, hints, and selection markers |
| `cursor` | current row, and the highlighted row in the `T` picker |
| `selection` | set to the same value as `selected` |
| `statusbar` | status bar background |
| `status_fg` | status bar text |
| `mode_fg` / `mode_bg` | mode chip text / background |
| `pri_a` `pri_b` `pri_c` `pri_d` | priorities A through D |
| `pri_other` | priorities E through Z |
| `project` | `+project` tags |
| `context` | `@context` tags |
| `due` | `due:` date |
| `overdue` | past-due date |
| `today` | date due today |
| `done` | completed tasks |
| `selected` | selected-row background (visual mode) and the active filter |
| `matched` | search-match highlight |

</details>

## Install

### Homebrew (macOS, Linux)

```sh
brew install tuxedo
```

### Prebuilt binaries

Download the archive for your platform from the [latest release](https://github.com/webstonehq/tuxedo/releases/latest) and put `tuxedo` on your `PATH`.

Targets: `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu`, `aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu`, `x86_64-apple-darwin`, `aarch64-apple-darwin`, `x86_64-pc-windows-msvc`. Each archive ships with a `.sha256` checksum.

### From source

```sh
cargo install --git https://github.com/webstonehq/tuxedo
```

Or clone and build:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/webstonehq/tuxedo
cd tuxedo
cargo build --release
./target/release/tuxedo [FILE]
```

Requires the Rust 2024 edition (recent stable toolchain).

## Usage

`tuxedo` is two things in one binary: an interactive TUI, and a one-shot
command line. With no subcommand it launches the TUI; with a recognized
subcommand it runs the [command line](#command-line-interface) and exits.

```sh
tuxedo [FILE]      # launch the TUI on FILE (created if missing)
tuxedo             # TUI on the default file (see resolution below)
tuxedo --sample    # open the bundled sample file in the temp dir
tuxedo <command>   # run a one-shot CLI command — see "Command-line interface"
tuxedo update      # print upgrade instructions for your install
tuxedo --help
tuxedo --version
```

When a newer release is available, the status bar shows `↑ <version> (tuxedo
update)` next to the version. The check runs in the background, is cached at
`$XDG_CACHE_HOME/tuxedo/latest_version.json` for 24 h, and fails silently
when offline. Set `TUXEDO_NO_UPDATE_CHECK=1` to disable.

### Which file tuxedo opens

Both the TUI and the CLI resolve the todo file the same way, in order:

1. An explicit `FILE` argument (TUI only).
2. `$TODO_FILE`, if set.
3. `$TODO_DIR/todo.txt`, if `$TODO_DIR` is set.
4. `./todo.txt` in the current directory, if it exists.
5. Otherwise the TUI shows a first-run prompt — press `c` to create
   `./todo.txt` here, or `s` to open a sample todo.txt in the system temp
   directory so you can poke around without committing to a path. (The
   one-shot CLI is non-interactive and uses the sample directly.)

The archive file is `$DONE_FILE` if set, otherwise a sibling `done.txt` next
to the todo file. The file (and any missing parent directories) is created on
first use. These are the same `TODO_DIR` / `TODO_FILE` / `DONE_FILE` variables
todo.txt-cli uses, so an existing `todo.cfg` works as-is:

```sh
export TODO_DIR="$HOME/Documents/todo"
export TODO_FILE="$TODO_DIR/todo.txt"
export DONE_FILE="$TODO_DIR/done.txt"
```

Edits are persisted on every change via atomic write (write `.tmp`, rename).

If the file changes on disk (another editor, a sync client, a script),
tuxedo notices on the next keypress, or within ~250 ms while idle, and
reloads. The keystroke that triggered the reload is consumed — press it
again to act on the fresh state — and the status bar flashes a notice.

Pressing `A` appends every completed task to a sibling `done.txt` and
removes them from the working file (atomically: `done.txt` is written
before the originals are dropped). `a` toggles the archive view so you
can browse, un-archive, or permanently delete past tasks.

## Command-line interface

When the first argument is a recognized subcommand, tuxedo runs a one-shot
command instead of launching the TUI. The surface mirrors
[todo.txt-cli](https://github.com/todotxt/todo.txt-cli/wiki/Usage) — same
commands, aliases, task numbering, and output — so it's a drop-in for scripts
and aliases.

```sh
tuxedo add "Pay rent +home @bank due:2026-07-01"   # or: tuxedo a "..."
tuxedo ls @bank                                     # filter by context
tuxedo do 3                                          # mark task 3 complete
tuxedo pri 3 A                                        # set priority
tuxedo archive                                        # move done tasks to done.txt
tuxedo ls --json | jq .                              # machine-readable output
```

| Command | Aliases | Arguments | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `add` | `a` | `TEXT...` | Add a task (natural-language dates supported, same as the `n` prompt). |
| `append` | `app` | `N TEXT...` | Append text to task `N`. |
| `prepend` | `prep` | `N TEXT...` | Prepend text to task `N`. |
| `replace` | | `N TEXT...` | Replace task `N` entirely. |
| `pri` | `p` | `N PRIORITY` | Set priority `A`–`Z` on task `N`. |
| `depri` | `dp` | `N...` | Remove priority from the given tasks. |
| `do` | `done`, `complete` | `N...` | Mark tasks complete (recurring tasks spawn their next instance). |
| `del` | `rm` | `N [TERM]` | Delete task `N`, or remove just `TERM` from it. Prompts unless `-f`. |
| `archive` | | | Move completed tasks to the done file. |
| `list` | `ls` | `[TERM...]` | List tasks. `TERM` is `+project`, `@context`, or free text. |
| `listall` | `lsa` | `[TERM...]` | List the todo file and the done file. |
| `listpri` | `lsp` | `[PRIORITY]` | List prioritized tasks (optionally a single priority). |
| `listproj` | `lsprj` | | List all `+projects`. |
| `listcon` | `lsc` | | List all `@contexts`. |

**Task numbers** are 1-based line numbers in the file, exactly as printed by
`list` — stable regardless of how the list is filtered or sorted. `list`
sorts by the full line (case-insensitive) and prints a `TODO: X of Y tasks
shown` footer, matching todo.txt-cli.

**Options:**

- `-f`, `--force` — skip confirmation prompts (e.g. for `del`).
- `--json` — emit machine-readable JSON instead of text. `list`-style commands
  print an array of task objects; mutating commands print a result object.
  No prompts or footers are written in this mode.

Global flags may appear before the subcommand (`tuxedo -f del 3`).

**Differences from todo.txt-cli:** `do` marks a task complete but does **not**
auto-archive it — completed tasks stay in the file until you run `archive` (or
press `A` in the TUI), matching tuxedo's interactive model. There is no `-d`
config-file flag; configure paths with the environment variables above.

## Keybindings

Custom normal-mode keybindings can be added in
`${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-$HOME/.config}/tuxedo/keybinds.toml`:

The block below lists every rebindable action with the key it ships with —
copy it, then change the keys you care about and delete the rest (anything you
leave out keeps its default). A value is a single key or an array of
alternatives, e.g. `begin_add = ["N", "Ctrl-n"]`.

```toml
[normal]

# Navigation
cursor_down    = ["j", "Down"]
cursor_up      = ["k", "Up"]
cursor_top     = "gg"
cursor_bottom  = "G"
half_page_down = "Ctrl-d"
half_page_up   = "Ctrl-u"

# Editing
begin_add            = "n"
begin_edit           = "e"
begin_edit_insert    = "i"
toggle_complete      = "x"
delete               = "dd"
reschedule           = "r"
cycle_priority       = "p"
begin_prompt_context = "c"
copy_line            = "yy"
copy_body            = "yb"
undo                 = "u"
# begin_prompt_project defaults to "+", which can't be written here (the
# parser reads "+" as a modifier separator). Pick another key to move it, e.g.
# begin_prompt_project = "P"

# Filtering, sort, view
begin_search        = "/"
arm_f               = "f"        # leader for the fp / fc / ff / fs chords
pick_project        = "fp"
pick_context        = "fc"
pick_saved_filter   = "ff"
save_current_filter = "fs"
cycle_sort          = "S"
toggle_visual       = "v"
toggle_selected     = "space"
go_list             = "l"
toggle_archive_view = "a"
archive_completed   = "A"
toggle_show_done    = "H"
toggle_show_future  = "F"

# Layout & theme
toggle_left_pane  = "["
toggle_right_pane = "]"
open_theme_picker = "T"
cycle_density     = "D"
toggle_line_num   = "L"
# cycle_theme has no default — bind a key to cycle themes without the picker:
# cycle_theme = "Ctrl-t"

# System
open_command_palette = [":", "Ctrl-P"]
open_share           = "s"
open_help            = "?"
open_settings        = ","
escape_stack         = "Esc"
quit                 = "q"
```

Custom bindings are checked before the defaults. The default bindings remain
available unless the same key or two-key chord is bound to another action in
the file. Action names are snake_case, matching the names in the command
palette where possible: `toggle_complete`, `pick_project`,
`open_theme_picker`, and so on. Key names can be single characters, two-key
chords like `ZZ`, modifier forms like `Ctrl-n` / `Alt-x`, named keys like
`Esc`, `Enter`, `Tab`, arrows, `Page-Up`, `Page-Down`, or `F1` through `F24`.

### Navigation

| Key | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `j` / `↓` | next task |
| `k` / `↑` | previous task |
| `gg` | first task |
| `G` | last task |
| `Ctrl-d` / `Ctrl-u` | half-page down / up |

### Editing

| Key | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `n` | add task |
| `e` | edit current task in Normal mode (see [Edit dialog](#edit-dialog)) |
| `i` | edit current task in Insert mode (see [Edit dialog](#edit-dialog)) |
| `x` | toggle complete |
| `dd` | delete task |
| `p` | cycle priority A → B → C → · |
| `c` | add or remove a context |
| `+` | add a project |
| `yy` | copy current line to clipboard |
| `yb` | copy current body only (no priority, dates, projects, contexts, `key:value`) |
| `u` | undo (50 levels) |

### Edit dialog

The edit dialog uses vim-style modal editing. Press `i` to edit the current task
starting in **Insert mode** — start typing immediately. Press `e` to start in
**Normal mode** so you can navigate before changing anything. The add prompt
(`n`) also opens directly in Insert mode.

The modal keys below apply in Normal mode:

| Key | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `h` / `←` | move cursor left |
| `l` / `→` | move cursor right |
| `w` | jump to start of next word |
| `b` | jump to start of previous word |
| `e` | jump to end of current word |
| `x` | delete character under cursor |
| `dw` | delete to start of next word |
| `cw` | delete to start of next word and enter Insert mode |
| `i` | enter Insert mode before cursor |
| `a` | enter Insert mode after cursor |
| `A` | enter Insert mode at end of line |
| `Esc` (in Insert) | return to Normal mode |
| `Esc` (in Normal) | cancel and close |
| `Enter` (in Insert) | save |

### Filtering, sort, view

| Key | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `/` | search |
| `fp` | filter by project (`j` / `k` cycles, `Esc` clears) |
| `fc` | filter by context (`j` / `k` cycles, `Esc` clears) |
| `ff` | pick a saved search (`j` / `k` cycles, `Enter` keeps, `Esc` reverts) |
| `fs` | save the active `/`-search as a named filter |
| `S` | cycle sort: priority → due → file order |
| `v` | enter visual / multi-select; `space` toggles a row |
| `x` / `dd` (in visual) | bulk-complete / bulk-delete the selection |
| `l` | list (default) view |
| `a` | toggle archive view |
| `A` | archive completed tasks → `done.txt` |
| `H` | toggle showing done tasks in the main list |

### Layout & theme

| Key | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `[` | toggle filter sidebar |
| `]` | toggle detail sidebar |
| `T` | open theme picker |
| `D` | cycle density: compact → comfortable → cozy |
| `L` | toggle line numbers |

### System

| Key | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `:` / `Ctrl-P` | command palette |
| `s` | share capture QR (phone PWA) |
| `?` | help overlay |
| `,` | settings overlay |
| `q` | quit |

Two-key chord prompts (`gg`, `dd`, `yy`, `yb`, `fp`, `fc`, `ff`, `fs`) show
a `g…` / `d…` / `y…` / `f…` indicator in the status-bar mode chip while the
leader is armed; the window is 600 ms.

Copy uses the OSC 52 terminal escape, so it works locally and over SSH on
any terminal that supports it (kitty, alacritty, wezterm, iTerm2, foot,
modern xterm; tmux when `set -g set-clipboard on`). Older terminals will
silently ignore the keystroke.

## todo.txt format

Standard [todo.txt](https://github.com/todotxt/todo.txt) lines:

```
(A) 2026-04-28 Call dentist @phone +health due:2026-05-08
```

- `(A)` — priority, A through Z (omit for none)
- `2026-04-28` — creation date in ISO 8601
- `+project` — project tag
- `@context` — context tag
- `key:value` — extension; `due:YYYY-MM-DD` is recognized for sort and
  due-bucket grouping in the list view. Keys you'd rather not see can be
  hidden from the rows via [`hide_keys`](#hiding-keyvalue-tags)
- `rec:[+]N{d,b,w,m,y}` — recurrence; on completion (`x`), tuxedo inserts
  a fresh copy of the task with `due:` advanced by `N` days, business
  days (Mon–Fri), weeks, months, or years. The `+` prefix means
  *strict* recurrence anchored to the previous due date (e.g.
  `rec:+1m` for monthly rent on the 15th); without it, the new due is
  computed from the completion date (e.g. `rec:1w` for "water plants
  one week after I last did").

Completed tasks are prefixed with `x ` and a completion date:

```
x 2026-05-05 2026-05-01 Submit expense report +work
```

Recurring example:

```
2026-05-09 Pay rent due:2026-05-15 rec:+1m
```

Pressing `x` on the line above marks the original complete *and* inserts
`2026-05-09 Pay rent due:2026-06-15 rec:+1m`. `u` undoes both at once.

## Natural-language add

Press `n` to open the add prompt. Type the task in plain English. When the
buffer contains recognized phrases (dates, weekdays, recurrence, project /
context names, priority), pressing Enter rewrites the draft into canonical
todo.txt — review or tweak it, then Enter again to save.

| What you type | What lands in the draft |
| --- | --- |
| `Pay rent monthly on the first of the month, show the todo 3 days before the due date. It's part of project home and context bank` | `Pay rent +home @bank due:2026-06-01 rec:+1m t:-3d` |
| `Buy milk tomorrow` | `Buy milk due:2026-05-12` |
| `Call mom every week starting Friday for project family` | `Call mom +family due:2026-05-15 rec:+1w` |
| `Submit timesheet every other friday show 1 day before` | `Submit timesheet due:2026-05-15 rec:+2w t:-1d` |
| `Daily standup high priority` | `(A) standup rec:+1d` |
| `Annual review April 15 +work @office` | `Annual review +work @office due:2027-04-15` |

Recognized vocabulary:

- **Dates** — `today`, `tonight`, `tomorrow`, `yesterday`, weekdays (`monday` / `mon` …), months (`april 15`, `15th of april`), `in 3 days`, `the first of the month`, ISO `2026-05-15`.
- **Recurrence** — `daily`, `weekly`, `biweekly`, `monthly`, `yearly`, `annually`, `every monday`, `every 2 weeks`, `every other friday`, `every business day`.
- **Threshold** — `show 3 days before due`, `2 weeks before due`.
- **Projects / contexts** — prose form `project home` and `context bank`, or the standard `+home` / `@bank` sigils.
- **Priority** — `high priority` → A, `medium priority` → B, `low priority` → C, or `priority A`.

Parsing is rule-based and runs locally — no network calls, no API key. If
the buffer already contains a `due:`, `rec:`, or `t:` token, tuxedo assumes
you've typed canonical form and saves it directly on the first Enter.

## Phone capture

Press `s` to start a tiny capture server on your machine's LAN address and
display a QR code for it. Scan it from your phone — any modern browser — to
get a minimal PWA you can install to your home screen. Type a task, tap
Add, and within a tick it shows up in your task list.

Captures never touch `todo.txt` directly. They land in a sibling
`inbox.txt`, which tuxedo drains on every external-change poll: each line
is run through the same natural-language pipeline as the `n` add prompt,
given a creation date if missing, and merged into `todo.txt` as a single
undoable batch (`u` rolls back the whole drain at once).

That makes `inbox.txt` a general capture endpoint, not just a PWA backend.
Anything that can append a line works as a producer:

```sh
echo "Refill prescription tomorrow" >> ~/notes/inbox.txt
echo "Call dentist due:2026-06-01" >> ~/notes/inbox.txt
```

Shell aliases, iOS Shortcuts writing to a synced folder, cron jobs,
email-to-file gateways — pick your producer. As long as it appends a line
to the sibling `inbox.txt`, tuxedo picks it up.

The server:

- Binds on first `s` press and stays up for the rest of the session.
  Subsequent `s` presses just re-show the QR; any key dismisses the
  overlay.
- Listens on `0.0.0.0:<port>` so phones on the same WiFi can reach it.
  The port is OS-assigned on first use and persisted to `config.toml` so
  phone bookmarks survive across sessions.
- Gates every protected route on a 64-character hex token baked into the
  URL path. The token is generated once, persisted to `config.toml`, and
  compared in constant time.
- Speaks plain HTTP — **trusted networks only.** On a shared or public
  WiFi anyone passive-sniffing can recover the token. To rotate, delete
  `share_token` from `config.toml` and press `s` again.

Drains from tuxedo-managed producers are crash-safe: the capture server
holds the same advisory lock as the TUI's rename-and-merge, and any
staging file left over from an interrupted drain is replayed on the
next session. Plain shell appends are useful for lightweight capture,
but they do not take that lock; use the capture server or the same lock
if a producer must be serialized with the TUI drain.

all update the file. Unknown keys are ignored, so older binaries don't break
on newer files.

Two additional keys, `share_token` and `share_port`, are written by the
[phone capture](#phone-capture) server on first use. Treat `share_token`
as a secret — anyone who has the value and LAN reach can append to your
inbox. Delete the key from `config.toml` to rotate it on the next `s`
press.

Saved searches (created with `fs`) are written one per line as
`filter.<name> = <query>`, where `<query>` is the `/`-search needle. They
round-trip as plain text, so you can add, rename, or delete them by editing
`config.toml` directly; a repeated `filter.<name>` keeps the last value, and
`<name>` may not contain `=`.

### Hiding `key:value` tags

Some `key:value` extensions are for machines, not eyes — e.g. a `uid:` you
sync against. Add a comma-separated `hide_keys` line to `config.toml` and
those keys' tokens are dropped from the task rows (list and archive views):

```toml
hide_keys = uid, sync
```

Matching is case-insensitive. Hiding is purely visual — the tags stay on
disk untouched, still serialize, and still show in the detail pane's **RAW**
section (a deliberate escape hatch). Searches still match hidden text; the
hidden characters just aren't drawn.

## Development

```sh
mise run fmt      # cargo fmt --all
mise run clippy   # cargo clippy --all-targets --locked -- -D warnings
mise run test     # cargo test --locked
```

CI runs all three on every push and pull request. Tasks are also runnable as
plain `cargo` commands if you don't use [mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/).

## Acknowledgments

- [todo.txt](http://todotxt.org/) by Gina Trapani — the format that makes a tool like this possible.
- [ratatui](https://ratatui.rs/) and [crossterm](https://github.com/crossterm-rs/crossterm) — the rendering and terminal-input crates tuxedo is built on.

## Roadmap

Planned and in-flight work lives in [`todo.txt`](./todo.txt) — eat your own dog food.

## Contributing

Issues and pull requests are welcome. For larger changes, please open an
issue first to discuss the approach. Run `mise run fmt clippy test` (or the
plain cargo equivalents) before submitting.
